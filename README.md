This is the website of an interactive science museum called the *Community Science Museum*. 
Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

## Description

The goal was to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive web presence for the client (fictional) - Community Science Museum.
The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. 
The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum.


A visitor should be able to:

- View a home page showing key information and impactful imagery.
- View a contact page showing the museum's address, phone number, opening hours and contact form.
- View information on how to contribute to the museum.
- View upcoming events and available exhibitions.
- View a privacy policy page and a terms and conditions page.
